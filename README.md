# robotics-brain
Repository for developing a state-of-the-art robotics brain using open-source models and innovative algorithms, with documentation and research papers.

## Overview

This project aims to build the next-generation robotics brain by leveraging state-of-the-art open-source vision–language–action (VLA) foundation models and by developing novel algorithms for perception, planning, control and learning. The repository will include research notes, prototype implementations, and papers that push the boundaries of embodied intelligence.

### State of the Art Models

We plan to explore and build upon several families of existing models that serve as the "brains" for modern robots:

- **VLA Foundation Models:** Models like **Gemini Robotics**, **RT‑2**, **OpenVLA**, **PaLM‑E**, and **NVIDIA Project GR00T** unify vision, language and action within a single architecture. They can take images and text as input and output high-level actions or plans. These models provide strong generalization across tasks and embodiments.

- **Generalist Robot Policies:** Models such as **RT‑1/RT‑X**, **Octo**, **RoboCat** and **Gato** learn to map sensor observations and language goals to low‑level control commands using massive cross‑robot datasets. They demonstrate broad manipulation skills and cross‑embodiment transfer.

- **Diffusion Policies:** The **Diffusion Policy** family models action distributions via denoising diffusion processes, achieving high success rates on imitation-learning tasks and offering efficient fine-tuning on new robots.

- **World‑Model Reinforcement Learning:** Approaches like **DreamerV3/DayDreamer** and **TD‑MPC2** learn a latent dynamics model of the environment and use planning to perform sample‑efficient online learning.

- **LLM‑Guided Planning:** Systems like **PaLM‑SayCan** integrate large language models with robot affordance models to generate high-level plans that are grounded in the robot’s capabilities and safety constraints.

These models constitute the starting point for our research.

### Research Directions

Beyond using existing models out‑of‑the‑box, this project will investigate new algorithms and methods, including but not limited to:

1. **Hybrid VLA‑Diffusion Architectures:** Combining the semantic understanding of VLA models with the precision control of diffusion policies for improved dexterity and robustness.

2. **Hierarchical World‑Models with Language Interface:** Building latent dynamics models that can be queried and updated via natural language, enabling robots to explain their plans and incorporate human feedback on‑the‑fly.

3. **Self‑Improving Generalist Agents:** Developing mechanisms for agents to automatically collect new data, adapt to unseen tasks and self‑train without human intervention, inspired by self‑play and curriculum learning.

4. **Multi‑Agent Collaboration:** Exploring communication protocols and coordination strategies for teams of robots, leveraging multi‑agent reinforcement learning and distributed foundation models.

5. **Safety‑Aware Planning and Execution:** Integrating formal safety constraints and uncertainty estimation into the planning loop to ensure robust operation in unstructured environments.

The **papers** directory will contain drafts and notes for original research papers arising from these directions.

### Getting Started

Currently this repository contains only a README. Future updates will include:

- Prototype code implementing baseline VLA policies and diffusion policies.
- Evaluation scripts and benchmarks based on public datasets (e.g., BridgeData V2, LIBERO).
- A `papers/` folder with LaTeX manuscripts and supplementary materials.

Contributions are welcome. Please open an issue or pull request if you have ideas or find issues.
