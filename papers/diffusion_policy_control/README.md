# Cross-Modal Diffusion Control for Robotic Manipulation

**Abstract**

This paper introduces Cross-Modal Diffusion Control (CMDC), a novel framework for robotic manipulation that extends diffusion policies to integrate multimodal sensory inputs. By framing the control policy as a conditional denoising diffusion process over a latent space that fuses vision, tactile, and proprioceptive information, CMDC learns to generate robust and precise action trajectories. The model is trained using a combination of behavioral cloning on expert demonstrations and can be fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. We hypothesize that this approach will significantly improve performance in contact-rich tasks and scenarios with partial observability, where no single modality is sufficient. We present the model architecture, training methodology, and a proposed set of experiments to validate its effectiveness.

## 1. Introduction

Recent advances in imitation learning have demonstrated the power of diffusion models for robotic control. Diffusion policies, in particular, have achieved state-of-the-art results by modeling the distribution of feasible action trajectories as a conditional denoising process. These models excel at capturing the nuances of complex manipulation tasks from expert demonstrations.

However, existing diffusion policies typically operate on a single sensory modality, such as vision or state estimates. This limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where robots must contend with noisy sensors, partial observability, and complex object interactions. For tasks like delicate assembly or dexterous manipulation, integrating information from multiple sources—such as vision for global context, tactile feedback for local contact forces, and proprioception for body awareness—is crucial for success.

To address this gap, we propose **Cross-Modal Diffusion Control (CMDC)**, a framework that learns a unified control policy from multimodal sensory inputs. Our key idea is to learn a shared latent space where information from different modalities can be effectively fused and used to condition a diffusion-based action generation process. This allows the policy to leverage the strengths of each sensor, for example, using vision to guide reaching and tactile feedback to modulate grasping forces.

## 2. Related Work

Our work builds on several key areas of research:

*   **Diffusion Models for Generative Modeling:** Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have emerged as a powerful class of generative models, achieving remarkable results in image and audio synthesis. They work by systematically adding noise to data and then learning a neural network to reverse the process.
*   **Diffusion Policies for Robotics:** Recent work has adapted diffusion models for imitation learning in robotics. By conditioning the denoising process on the robot's observation, a "diffusion policy" can generate actions that mimic expert behavior. These policies have been shown to be more expressive and robust than previous methods like behavioral cloning with L2 loss or Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL).
*   **Multimodal Learning in Robotics:** Fusing information from multiple sensors has long been a goal in robotics. Early approaches relied on hand-crafted fusion mechanisms, while more recent work uses deep learning to learn joint representations from raw sensory data. However, effectively integrating these representations into a control policy remains a challenge.

CMDC bridges the gap between diffusion policies and multimodal learning, offering a principled way to train robust control policies that leverage the full spectrum of a robot's sensory capabilities.

## 3. Proposed Method: Cross-Modal Diffusion Control

The core of CMDC is a conditional diffusion model that generates action sequences based on a fused representation of multimodal observations.

### 3.1. Multimodal Observation Encoder

The first step in our framework is to encode the raw sensory inputs into a common latent space. We use separate encoders for each modality:

*   **Vision Encoder ($E_v$):** A convolutional neural network (CNN), such as a pre-trained ResNet, processes camera images.
*   **Tactile Encoder ($E_t$):** A small MLP or CNN processes data from tactile sensors.
*   **Proprioceptive Encoder ($E_p$):** An MLP encodes joint angles, velocities, and other robot state information.

The outputs of these encoders are then combined, for example, through concatenation followed by a linear projection, to produce a single multimodal observation vector **o**.

### 3.2. Conditional Diffusion Process

The policy is modeled as a conditional denoising diffusion process. We start with a random action sequence **a_T** sampled from a Gaussian distribution. The model then iteratively denoises this sequence over **T** steps to produce a clean action sequence **a_0**:

**a_{t-1} = D(a_t, o, t)**

where **D** is a neural network (the denoiser) that takes the noisy action **a_t**, the multimodal observation **o**, and the diffusion timestep **t** as input. The denoiser is trained to predict the less noisy action **a_{t-1}**.

The loss function for training the denoiser is typically a simplified version of the evidence lower bound (ELBO), which can be expressed as:

**L = E_{t, o, a_0, \epsilon} [ || \epsilon - \epsilon_\theta(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}a_0 + \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_t}\epsilon, o) ||^2 ]**

where **a_0** is the ground-truth action, **\epsilon** is the sampled noise, and **\epsilon_\theta** is the network predicting the noise from the noisy action.

### 3.3. Code Implementation

We provide an improved code skeleton for the proposed CMDC policy. This version includes a more structured architecture with separate encoders and a more detailed denoiser network.

## 4. Proposed Experiments

To validate the effectiveness of CMDC, we propose a series of experiments in simulated and real-world environments.

*   **Simulated Contact-Rich Tasks:** We will use a physics simulator like MuJoCo or Isaac Gym to create tasks that require precise force control, such as peg-in-hole, connector plugging, and wiping a surface. We will compare CMDC against single-modality baselines (vision-only, tactile-only) and other state-of-the-art imitation learning methods.
*   **Ablation Studies:** We will conduct ablation studies to analyze the contribution of each modality. By training policies with different subsets of sensors, we can quantify the performance gains from multimodal fusion.
*   **Real-World Demonstration:** We will deploy the trained policy on a real robotic platform (e.g., a Franka Emika arm with a GelSight tactile sensor) to demonstrate its ability to handle the complexities of real-world physics and sensor noise.

## 5. Conclusion

Cross-Modal Diffusion Control offers a promising direction for developing more robust and capable robotic manipulation systems. By learning to fuse and leverage multimodal sensory information within a powerful generative policy framework, we believe CMDC can overcome many of the limitations of current methods. Future work will explore extensions to dynamic environments, lifelong learning, and the integration of language for high-level task specification.
