## Diffusion-Based Control Policy

**Summary**

Diffusion policy is a state-of-the-art imitation learning algorithm for robot control that frames the policy as a conditional denoising diffusion process. It models the distribution of feasible action trajectories by adding noise and then learning to denoise them conditioned on observations and goals. This approach achieves a 46.9% improvement over prior state-of-the-art imitation learning methods across twelve manipulation tasks, uses Langevin dynamics with a receding-horizon formulation, and has been open sourced【50664686928342†L14-L31】.

**Proposed Idea**

We propose to extend diffusion policies to a **cross‑modal diffusion control** framework that can fuse vision, tactile, and proprioceptive inputs. The model learns a latent diffusion process over multimodal observations and action sequences and uses an adaptive noise schedule conditioned on task context. At inference time, the model denoises a random action sequence into a feasible trajectory that simultaneously satisfies visual and tactile constraints. The model can be trained via behavioural cloning on demonstrations and fine‑tuned with reinforcement learning. This cross‑modal approach could enable robust manipulation under partial observability and contact‑rich tasks.
