# GPU-Parallel Motion Planning

This research paper proposes an algorithm that leverages GPUs to evaluate thousands of possible manipulation plans in parallel and refine the best candidate to meet robot and environment constraints. Building on the MIT and NVIDIA research where robots "think ahead" by testing thousands of potential actions simultaneously for rapid packing and manipulation tasks【832981533748937†L177-L186】, our approach generalizes the method to dynamic tasks and uses reinforcement learning to update candidate plans in real time. Our goal is to enable robots to solve multistep manipulation problems in seconds, with improved generality and safety.

## Idea

1. **Parallel Sampling:** Use GPUs to sample a large batch of action sequences (candidate plans) and evaluate them in parallel using a differentiable dynamics model.
2. **Selection and Refinement:** Select top candidates based on a cost function (e.g., collision avoidance, stability, task completion) and refine them via gradient-based optimization or reinforcement learning.
3. **Real-Time Adaptation:** Integrate the planner into a closed-loop control system that continuously updates plans as new sensor information arrives.

## Research Goals

- Scale the number of samples to tens of thousands of candidate plans without significant latency.
- Incorporate physics-based constraints and learned world models for accurate scoring of candidate plans.
- Demonstrate the approach on complex manipulation tasks (e.g., packing objects, assembly) and compare to existing planners.

## References

The approach is inspired by the MIT/NVIDIA algorithm for parallel planning that uses GPUs to evaluate and refine thousands of possible solutions simultaneously【832981533748937†L177-L186】.
