# Papers

This folder will store research papers and drafts proposing entirely new ideas and algorithms for the next generation of robotics brains. Each subfolder or file should correspond to a specific research topic or manuscript.

## Suggested Topics

- Novel architectures combining vision–language–action foundation models with diffusion policies and world models for improved dexterity and reasoning.
- Techniques for self-supervised robotic learning using large-scale simulation and unsupervised data collection.
- Methods for safe and ethical deployment of generalist robot brains in real-world settings.
- Multi-agent cooperation and communication strategies in robotic teams.

To add a paper, create a new subfolder (e.g. `papers/hybrid_vla_diffusion/`) containing your manuscript (LaTeX, Markdown, or PDF) and supplementary materials.
