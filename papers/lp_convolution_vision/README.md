# Lp-Convolution for Brain-Inspired Robot Vision

## Summary
Traditional convolutional neural networks use fixed square kernels, but human visual cortex uses receptive fields of varying shapes. Researchers proposed Lp‑Convolution, which reshapes convolutional filters using a multivariate p-generalized normal distribution【726305883587174†L39-L84】. The Lp‑Conv layer can adapt its kernel shape by learning the p value, reducing computational cost and improving accuracy. Experiments showed that Lp‑Conv networks outperform standard CNNs on image classification and are robust to corrupted data【726305883587174†L98-L107】, making them promising for robotic perception.

## Proposed Idea
We propose to integrate Lp‑Convolution into a robot vision stack for manipulation and navigation tasks. The network will learn task‑specific p values for different layers, enabling dynamic adjustment of receptive fields. A reinforcement-learning controller will adjust p values online based on environment complexity and sensor noise. This approach aims to improve robustness to lighting and motion blur while maintaining efficiency on embedded hardware.

## Code skeleton
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.nn.functional as F

class LpConv2d(nn.Module:
    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, p=2.0, bias=True):
        super().__init__()
        self.p = nn.Parameter(torch.tensor(float(p)))
        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(out_channels, in_channels, *kernel_size))
        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(out_channels)) if bias else None

    def forward(self, x):
        # normalize kernel using p-generalized normal distribution
        p_val = torch.clamp(self.p, min=0.5, max=10.0)
        weight = self.weight / (torch.sum(torch.abs(self.weight) ** p_val, dim=(2,3), keepdim=True) + 1e-6) ** (1.0 / p_val)
        out = F.conv2d(x, weight, bias=self.bias, padding='same')
        return out

class VisionNet(nn.Module:
    def __init__(self, num_classes=10):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = LpConv2d(3, 32, kernel_size=(5,5), p=2.0)
        self.conv2 = LpConv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=(5,5), p=2.0)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64*8*8, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = F.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = F.avg_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = F.relu(self.conv2(x))
        x = F.avg_pool2d(x, 2)
        x = x.view(x.size(0), -1)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        return self.fc2(x)

# Example usage:
# model = VisionNet(num_classes=100)
# images = torch.randn(16, 3, 32, 32)
# outputs = model(images)
```

This skeleton defines an `LpConv2d` layer that normalizes its weights based on a learnable p parameter, and a simple vision network using two such layers. Future work could implement dynamic p adjustment via reinforcement learning and evaluate on robotics perception datasets.
