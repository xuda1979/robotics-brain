# Adaptive Lp-Convolution for Robust Robotic Vision

**Abstract**

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are the cornerstone of modern robot vision, yet they typically rely on rigid, square-shaped convolutional kernels. This design contrasts with the biological visual cortex, where receptive fields are diverse and adaptive. This paper proposes the integration of Lp-Convolution, a brain-inspired variant of standard convolution, into robotic vision systems. Lp-Convolutional layers can dynamically change the shape of their kernels by learning a parameter, `p`, which controls the Lp-norm used for weight normalization. This allows the network to learn elliptical, rectangular, or diamond-shaped receptive fields, better matching the statistics of the visual world. We further propose a meta-learning framework to dynamically adjust these `p` values online in response to environmental conditions, such as motion blur or low light. We hypothesize that this adaptive approach will lead to robotic vision systems that are more robust, efficient, and better able to generalize across diverse and challenging real-world scenarios.

## 1. Introduction

For a robot to operate reliably in the unstructured real world, its vision system must be robust to a myriad of challenges: changing lighting, motion blur, occlusions, and novel objects. While deep CNNs have achieved superhuman performance on benchmark datasets, their performance can degrade significantly when faced with these real-world variations.

A potential reason for this brittleness is the architectural rigidity of standard CNNs, which almost exclusively use fixed, square convolutional filters. This is biologically implausible and may be suboptimal for learning efficient representations of the natural world. Recent research has introduced **Lp-Convolution (Lp-Conv)**, a generalization of standard convolution where the filter weights are normalized using an Lp-norm, with `p` being a learnable parameter. By learning `p`, the layer can effectively reshape its kernel, interpolating between a diamond shape (p=1) and a square shape (p=infinity), allowing it to adapt its feature detectors to the task at hand.

This paper proposes to leverage Lp-Conv for robotic vision. We advocate for two key innovations:
1.  **End-to-End Learning of Kernel Shapes:** By incorporating Lp-Conv layers into standard vision backbones (e.g., ResNet), the network can learn the optimal receptive field shape for each layer through backpropagation.
2.  **Dynamic Adaptation of Kernel Shapes:** We propose a meta-learning or reinforcement learning-based controller that can modulate the `p` values of the network in real-time based on the input statistics. For example, the network could learn to use more elongated, horizontal kernels to compensate for motion blur.

This adaptive, brain-inspired approach promises to yield more robust and computationally efficient vision models for robotics.

## 2. Related Work

*   **Deformable Convolution:** Deformable convolutions learn an offset for each kernel element, allowing them to adapt to geometric variations in the input. Lp-Conv is a complementary approach that adapts the kernel's shape itself, rather than just the sampling locations.
*   **Adaptive Architectures:** There is a growing interest in networks that can adapt their architecture or parameters at inference time. Examples include early-exiting networks and conditional computation. Our proposed dynamic adjustment of `p` values falls into this category.
*   **Neuro-inspired Vision:** The design of Lp-Conv is directly inspired by the diversity of receptive field shapes found in the visual cortex. This work continues a long tradition of looking to neuroscience for inspiration to build more powerful AI systems.

## 3. Proposed Method: Adaptive Lp-Convolution

Our proposed system is a CNN where standard `Conv2d` layers are replaced with our adaptive `LpConv2d` layers.

### 3.1. The Lp-Conv Layer

The `LpConv2d` layer is identical to a standard convolutional layer, except for how its weights are normalized before the convolution operation. Given a weight tensor **W**, it is normalized as:

**W_norm = W / ( ||W||_p + Îµ )**

where `||W||_p` is the Lp-norm of the spatial dimensions of the kernel, calculated as `(sum(|w_ij|^p))^(1/p)`. The value of `p` is a learnable parameter for each layer, allowing the network to control the "shape" of the normalization constraint.

### 3.2. Dynamic p-Value Adjustment

While `p` can be learned as a static parameter for a given dataset, we propose a dynamic controller to adjust it on the fly. A small meta-network, **C**, could take the input image (or features from an early layer) and output a set of `p` values, one for each `LpConv2d` layer in the main network. This controller, **C**, could be trained with reinforcement learning, where the reward is based on the main task's performance and a penalty for computational cost.

### 3.3. Code Implementation

The code below defines the `LpConv2d` layer and a simple vision network using it. The `p` parameter is made learnable via `nn.Parameter`.

        weight_norm = self.weight / (norm ** (1.0 / p_val))

        # Perform standard convolution with the normalized weights
        out = F.conv2d(x, weight_norm, bias=self.bias, padding=self.padding)
        return out

        self.conv2 = LpConv2d(32, 64, kernel_size=(5, 5), initial_p=2.0)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)

        # Placeholder for flattened size; depends on input image size
        # Assuming 32x32 input -> 64 * 8 * 8 output after two pools
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(64 * 8 * 8, 128)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(128, num_classes)

    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))

        # Flatten the tensor for the fully connected layers

        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Example usage

    # Create the model
    model = LpVisionNet(num_classes=100)

    # Create a dummy batch of images

```

## 4. Proposed Experiments

*   **Image Classification under Corruption:** We will evaluate the `LpVisionNet` on benchmark datasets like ImageNet-C, which contains corrupted versions of the ImageNet validation set (e.g., with blur, noise, fog). We hypothesize that the adaptive kernels of Lp-Conv will provide greater robustness compared to a standard ResNet baseline.
*   **Robotic Grasping:** We will integrate the `LpVisionNet` as the perception backbone for a robotic grasping system. The task will involve grasping objects in cluttered scenes with varying lighting conditions. We will measure success rate and compare it to a baseline using standard convolutions.
*   **Dynamic `p` Evaluation:** We will implement the dynamic controller for `p` values and test it on a task where the environment changes predictably, such as a robot moving at different speeds (inducing different amounts of motion blur). We will analyze how the learned `p` values change in response to the environment.

## 5. Conclusion

By replacing the rigid, fixed-shape kernels of standard CNNs with the adaptive, learnable kernels of Lp-Convolution, we can create more robust and efficient vision systems for robotics. This brain-inspired approach allows the network to tailor its feature detectors to the specific statistics of the task and environment. The proposed framework, especially with the addition of dynamic online adaptation, represents a promising step towards building robotic perception systems that can match the robustness of biological vision.
