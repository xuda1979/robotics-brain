# Neuromorphic SLAM: Continuous Learning with Spiking Neural Networks

**Abstract**

Biological brains, particularly the hippocampus, exhibit remarkable navigation capabilities while consuming minuscule amounts of energy. This efficiency is largely due to sparse, event-driven computation using spiking neurons. This paper proposes a neuromorphic SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) system that leverages Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) and event-based cameras to achieve continuous, online learning for robotic navigation. Our system learns a map of the environment, represented by a population of "place cells" implemented as spiking neurons. Critically, the system updates its synaptic weights on the fly using a bio-inspired Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) rule. This allows the robot to explore novel environments and continuously update its internal map without the need for offline training or separate learning phases. The proposed architecture is designed for extreme efficiency, making it suitable for deployment on low-power neuromorphic hardware or microcontrollers for long-duration autonomous robotics.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional SLAM algorithms, while powerful, are often computationally intensive, posing a challenge for small, power-constrained robots. Nature offers an alternative blueprint. The brains of navigating animals use specialized neurons like place cells and grid cells, which fire spikes to represent the animal's location. This computation is sparse, event-driven, and incredibly energy-efficient.

Inspired by this, we propose a fully spiking, neuromorphic SLAM system. Our approach combines two key technologies:
1.  **Event Cameras:** These sensors mimic the retina by reporting only changes in brightness, producing a sparse stream of "events" instead of dense frames. This reduces data redundancy and power consumption at the sensor level.
2.  **Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs):** SNNs are the "processors" of our system. They operate on the sparse event stream directly, using neuron models that integrate inputs over time and fire spikes only when their membrane potential reaches a threshold.

The core of our system is a set of SNN-based place cells that learn to fire selectively for specific locations. Unlike previous neuromorphic navigation systems that rely on pre-trained networks, our system learns *online*. We employ a Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity (STDP) learning rule, a biologically plausible mechanism where the change in synaptic strength depends on the relative timing of pre- and post-synaptic spikes. This allows the network to constantly adapt its synapses as the robot explores, creating new place representations for novel areas while reinforcing existing ones.

## 2. Related Work

*   **Neuromorphic Engineering:** This field aims to build computing systems inspired by the brain. Hardware like Loihi and SpiNNaker provides platforms for running large-scale SNNs efficiently. Our proposed system is designed to be compatible with such hardware.
*   **Event-Based SLAM:** Several systems have been developed to perform SLAM using event cameras. Many of these, however, still rely on traditional frame-like event representations and conventional algorithms. Our work focuses on a fully spike-based processing pipeline.
*   **SNNs for Place Recognition:** Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of using SNNs for place recognition. These systems typically require offline training on a dataset of the target environment. Our key contribution is the addition of continuous online learning, enabling true autonomous exploration.

## 3. Proposed Method: Online Neuromorphic SLAM

Our system consists of an event processing front-end and a learning-enabled SNN core.

### 3.1. SNN Architecture

The core of the system is a simple two-layer SNN.
*   **Input Layer:** Neurons in this layer are fed data from the event camera. The input could be a flattened grid of event counts over a small time window.
*   **Place Cell Layer:** This is a layer of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons. Each neuron is a potential "place cell." The weights connecting the input layer to the place cell layer are initially random.

### 3.2. Online Learning with STDP

The network learns through an unsupervised STDP mechanism.
*   **Winner-Take-All (WTA):** When an input is presented, the place cell that receives the strongest input and fires first is considered the "winner." Lateral inhibition connections (not explicitly modeled in the skeleton below for simplicity) would silence other neurons.
*   **Synaptic Potentiation:** The synapses connecting the input neurons that fired to the winning place cell are strengthened. This makes the winning cell more likely to fire again for similar input patterns in the future.
*   **Synaptic Depression:** Synapses connected to non-firing input neurons may be weakened.

This process ensures that different place cells become selective for different input patterns, which, due to the nature of vision, correspond to different places in the environment.

### 3.3. Code Implementation

The following code provides a simplified, runnable skeleton of the core SNN components. It uses a basic LIF neuron model and demonstrates a conceptual STDP update.

## 4. Proposed Experiments

*   **Topological Mapping Task:** We will test the system in a simulated environment where a robot must explore an unknown space. We will evaluate its ability to form a consistent topological map, where different place cells correspond to distinct locations and the transitions between them are correctly identified.
*   **Long-Term Stability:** A key challenge in online learning is stability. We will conduct long-duration experiments where the robot repeatedly traverses the same environment to ensure that the learned map remains stable and does not suffer from catastrophic forgetting or drift.
*   **Hardware Deployment:** We will deploy the SNN-based SLAM system on a low-power platform (e.g., a microcontroller or neuromorphic hardware) paired with a real event camera on a mobile robot. We will measure the power consumption and compare it to traditional SLAM methods.

## 5. Conclusion

By combining the efficiency of event cameras and spiking neural networks with the adaptability of online synaptic plasticity, our proposed neuromorphic SLAM system offers a promising path towards truly autonomous and long-duration robotics. This brain-inspired approach moves away from the traditional "train then deploy" paradigm, instead embracing a continuous learning model that is better suited for the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the real world.
