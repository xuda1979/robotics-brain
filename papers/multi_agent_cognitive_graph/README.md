## Multi-Agent Cognitive Graph for Embodied AI

**Summary**

Real‑world embodied AI often involves multiple agents operating in complex, dynamic environments requiring cooperation and coordination. A 2025 review notes that most research on embodied AI focuses on single-agent settings and lacks systematic methods for multi-agent collaboration, despite the importance of social and cooperative behaviors【301099242853699†L109-L127】.

**Proposed Idea**

We propose a **Multi‑Agent Cognitive Graph** framework that represents a team of robots as a dynamic graph. Each agent is a node with attributes encoding its sensory observations, internal state, and current plan, and edges represent communication links or physical proximity. A graph neural network performs message passing to allow agents to share information and coordinate their actions. A central planner builds a high-level task graph and assigns subgoals to agents based on their capabilities and locations. The cognitive graph is updated in real time as agents move and the environment changes, enabling robust coordination in search‑and‑rescue, exploration, and cooperative manipulation scenarios. Learning to update and exploit the cognitive graph can be framed as a meta‑learning problem across multiple tasks.
