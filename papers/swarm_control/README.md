# Adaptive Swarm Control for Cyborg Insects

**Abstract**

Cyborg insects, or "biobots," offer a unique solution for search-and-rescue and environmental monitoring by leveraging the unparalleled efficiency of biological locomotion. Recent work has demonstrated simple leader-follower control for insect swarms, but these methods often rely on a fixed leader and pre-programmed behaviors. This paper proposes an **Adaptive Swarm Control** framework that enables dynamic leader election and decentralized, learned coordination. In our model, each cyborg insect is an autonomous agent that estimates its own state, including battery level and proximity to a goal. Leadership is not fixed but is dynamically assigned to the agent best positioned to guide the swarm, balancing energy consumption and task progress across the team. Agents share low-bandwidth information to build a distributed map of the environment, and a decentralized policy, trained with multi-agent reinforcement learning, governs both leader election and follower behavior. This approach promises to create more robust, resilient, and efficient biobot swarms capable of complex, long-duration missions.

## 1. Introduction

The use of cyborg insects—real insects equipped with micro-electronic backpacks—is a rapidly advancing field. By tapping into an insect's neuromuscular system, we can control its movement, effectively creating a tiny, energy-efficient "biobot." While controlling a single biobot is challenging, coordinating a swarm of them presents a far greater opportunity and a more complex problem.

Current swarm control algorithms often use a simple leader-follower model where one insect is designated as the leader and the others follow its commands. This is effective but has limitations:
*   **Single Point of Failure:** The designated leader may get stuck or run out of energy, jeopardizing the entire mission.
*   **Lack of Adaptability:** A fixed leader may not always have the best sensory information or be in the optimal position to guide the swarm.

To overcome these issues, we propose an **Adaptive Swarm Control** framework based on two core principles:
1.  **Dynamic Leader Election:** Instead of a fixed leader, our system continuously re-evaluates which agent is best suited for leadership. The decision is based on factors like remaining battery life, sensory input quality, and proximity to the mission goal. This balances the energy load and ensures the most capable agent is always in charge.
2.  **Decentralized Intelligence:** Each agent runs a learned policy that allows it to act semi-autonomously. Agents share information about their local environment, contributing to a distributed map. This allows followers to behave intelligently (e.g., avoiding obstacles) even when not receiving direct commands from the leader.

This framework, trained using multi-agent reinforcement learning, will allow the swarm to exhibit more complex and robust collective behaviors, significantly advancing the capabilities of biobot systems.

## 2. Related Work

*   **Cyborg Insect Technology:** Research in this area has focused on the hardware (backpacks, electrodes) and the low-level control of inducing movement in insects like beetles and moths.
*   **Swarm Intelligence:** This field draws inspiration from social insects like ants and bees to design algorithms for multi-robot coordination. Classic examples include particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization.
*   **Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL):** As in other multi-agent domains, MARL provides the tools to learn complex, coordinated policies that would be impossible to hand-design. Our work applies MARL to the specific challenges of controlling a biobot swarm.

## 3. Proposed Method: Adaptive Swarm Control

Our system models the swarm as a collection of `InsectAgent` objects, managed by a `SwarmController`.

### 3.1. The Insect Agent

Each agent maintains its own state, including:
*   `id`: A unique identifier.
*   `position`: Its estimated location.
*   `battery`: Remaining energy level.
*   `is_leader`: A boolean flag.
*   `local_map_data`: Information it has gathered about its surroundings.

The agent's battery depletes at a higher rate when it is acting as the leader.

### 3.2. The Swarm Controller and Leader Election

The `SwarmController` is a conceptual entity that orchestrates the swarm. Its primary role is to facilitate leader election. At each step, it runs an election protocol. A simple protocol could be:

**`fitness = w1 * battery + w2 * goal_proximity + w3 * map_quality`**

The agent with the highest fitness score is elected the new leader. The weights `w1, w2, w3` could be learned.

### 3.3. Policy Learning

A MARL algorithm would be used to train a policy for each agent. The policy would take the agent's state and any messages from the leader as input, and output a low-level motor command (e.g., "turn left," "move forward"). The reward function would be designed to encourage exploration, goal completion, and energy conservation.

### 3.4. Code Implementation

The following Python code provides a more structured, object-oriented skeleton for the proposed system.

```python
import numpy as np
from typing import List, Dict

class InsectAgent:
    """Represents a single cyborg insect with its own state."""
    def __init__(self, agent_id: int, initial_pos: np.ndarray, battery: float = 1.0):
        self.id = agent_id
        self.position = initial_pos
        self.battery = battery
        self.is_leader = False

        # Costs for battery depletion
        self.leader_cost_rate = 0.1
        self.follower_cost_rate = 0.05

    def update(self, dt: float):
        """Updates the agent's battery based on its role."""
        cost = self.leader_cost_rate if self.is_leader else self.follower_cost_rate
        self.battery = max(0.0, self.battery - cost * dt)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Agent(id={self.id}, pos={self.position}, bat={self.battery:.2f}, leader={self.is_leader})"

class SwarmController:
    """Manages the swarm, including leader election and motion planning."""
    def __init__(self, agents: List[InsectAgent], target_pos: np.ndarray):
        self.agents = agents
        self.target_pos = target_pos
        self.leader: InsectAgent = None

    def elect_leader(self):
        """
        Elects a leader based on a fitness score.
        Here, fitness is a weighted sum of battery and proximity to a frontier.
        """
        # For simplicity, we'll use battery level as the primary criterion.
        # A real implementation would be more complex (e.g., proximity to an exploration frontier).
        best_agent = max(self.agents, key=lambda a: a.battery)

        if self.leader != best_agent:
            if self.leader is not None:
                self.leader.is_leader = False
            self.leader = best_agent
            self.leader.is_leader = True
            print(f"\nNew Leader Elected: Agent {self.leader.id}")

    def plan_motion_for_leader(self) -> np.ndarray:
        """
        The leader plans a motion vector. Here, it's a simple move towards the target.
        """
        if self.leader is None:
            return np.zeros(2)

        direction = self.target_pos - self.leader.position
        norm = np.linalg.norm(direction)
        if norm > 1e-6:
            return direction / norm
        return np.zeros(2)

    def step(self, dt: float):
        """Performs one simulation step for the entire swarm."""
        self.elect_leader()

        leader_velocity = self.plan_motion_for_leader()

        # Leader broadcasts command, all agents (including leader) follow it
        # A more advanced model would have followers use a learned policy
        for agent in self.agents:
            # Simulate motion and noise
            noise = np.random.randn(2) * 0.1
            agent.position = agent.position + (leader_velocity + noise) * dt
            agent.update(dt)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    num_agents = 5
    initial_positions = [np.random.rand(2) * 5 for _ in range(num_agents)]
    agents = [InsectAgent(i, pos) for i, pos in enumerate(initial_positions)]

    controller = SwarmController(agents, target_pos=np.array([50.0, 50.0]))

    print("--- Initial Swarm State ---")
    for agent in agents:
        print(agent)

    # Simulate for a few steps
    for t in range(100):
        controller.step(dt=0.1)
        if (t + 1) % 25 == 0:
            print(f"\n--- State at t={(t+1)*0.1:.1f}s ---")
            for agent in agents:
                print(agent)

    print("\nCode skeleton runs successfully.")
```

## 4. Proposed Experiments

*   **Exploration Task:** We will test the adaptive swarm in a simulated environment with obstacles. The task will be to explore a certain percentage of the map. We will measure the time taken and the total energy consumed by the swarm, and compare it to a baseline with a fixed leader.
*   **Resilience to Failure:** We will simulate leader failure by rapidly depleting the leader's battery. We will measure how quickly the swarm adapts, elects a new leader, and continues the mission.
*   **Scalability:** We will evaluate the performance of the system as the number of agents in the swarm increases, to ensure the coordination strategy is scalable.

## 5. Conclusion

The proposed Adaptive Swarm Control framework offers a more robust and efficient method for coordinating teams of cyborg insects. By enabling dynamic leader election and laying the groundwork for learned, decentralized policies, this approach moves beyond simple, rigid control schemes. It represents a critical step towards deploying biobot swarms that are resilient, adaptable, and capable of performing complex, long-duration missions in the real world.
