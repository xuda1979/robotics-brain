# Leader-Follower Swarm Control for Cyborg Insects

## Summary
Recent research demonstrated a leader–follower algorithm for cyborg insect swarms. A designated leader coordinates other insects by broadcasting turning signals. The algorithm reduces the need for human nudges and helps insects assist each other, preventing them from getting stuck【524126520806655†L70-L116】. Cyborg insects are energy efficient and can be used for search‑and‑rescue missions because they use the insects' muscles as actuators【524126520806655†L70-L116】.

## Proposed Idea
We propose an adaptive leader‑follower swarm control system that dynamically selects leaders based on local sensory feedback and energy levels. Each insect estimates its battery level and proximity to the goal; leadership is rotated to balance workload and prevent fatigue. Agents share environmental information through low‑bandwidth radio signals to build a distributed map. A reinforcement learning policy will learn to choose the best leader and motion commands to maximize swarm coverage and minimize collisions.

## Code skeleton
```python
import numpy as np

class InsectAgent:
    def __init__(self, id, battery=1.0):
        self.id = id
        self.battery = battery
        self.position = np.zeros(2)
        self.is_leader = False

    def broadcast(self, message, agents):
        for agent in agents:
            if agent.id != self.id:
                agent.receive(message)

    def receive(self, message):
        # update local map or follow leader commands
        pass

    def update_battery(self, dt):
        self.battery -= dt * (0.1 if self.is_leader else 0.05)
        self.battery = max(self.battery, 0.0)

class SwarmController:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        self.agents = agents

    def elect_leader(self):
        # choose agent with highest battery near frontier
        leader = max(self.agents, key=lambda a: a.battery)
        for agent in self.agents:
            agent.is_leader = (agent == leader)

    def step(self, observations):
        # update leader if necessary
        self.elect_leader()
        # leader computes path and broadcasts commands
        leader = next(a for a in self.agents if a.is_leader)
        command = self.plan_motion(leader, observations)
        leader.broadcast(command, self.agents)
        # update agent states
        for agent in self.agents:
            agent.update_battery(dt=0.01)

    def plan_motion(self, leader, observations):
        # dummy motion plan: move toward target
        target = np.array([10.0, 0.0])
        direction = (target - leader.position)
        direction = direction / (np.linalg.norm(direction) + 1e-6)
        return {'velocity': direction}

# Example usage
agents = [InsectAgent(i) for i in range(10)]
controller = SwarmController(agents)
for t in range(1000):
    observations = {}  # sensor data placeholder
    controller.step(observations)
```

This skeleton models each cyborg insect as an agent with a battery and position. The `SwarmController` elects a leader, plans a simple motion toward a target, and broadcasts commands. A real implementation would integrate sensing, collision avoidance, and learning-based leader election.
